### DBS/Tracks

This folder has some code used to scrap song from XLM file to transform in a database file - (*.sqlite)

#### Contains:
- (tracks.py): script
- (trackdb.sqlite): database file
- (Library.xml): xml file


### To export your own Library.xml from iTunes 

- File -> Library -> Export Library

Make sure it is in the correct folder.   
Of course iTUnes might change UI and/or export format any time - so good luck :)
